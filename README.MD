# Uber Stream Data Processing

## Objective of the project
* Identify scenarios where stream processing is the preferred model.
* Discuss fault tolerance and high performance mechanisms employed in streaming frameworks.
* Describe how Kafka and Samza integrate together to achieve fault-tolerance.
* Generate a stream of data using Kafka and make it available for a Samza consumer.
* Design and implement a solution to join and process multiple streams of GPS data using the Samza API to enable a driver matching service like Uber.
